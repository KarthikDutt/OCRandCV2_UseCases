# OCRandCV2_UseCases

The objective here is to implement couple of use cases which will demonstrate the working of Tesseract OCR with Open CV. 
Following are the use cases that are implemented:

    Use case 1 - Converting the data in images to a structured format and then applying dedupe or any other DQ processes on it
    Use Case 2 - Apply various image processing technique to demonstrate the increase of OCR accuracy with image quality.
    
Prerequisites:

Following are the components that are prerequisites and must be installed:

- Tesseract 
- Pytesseract (Python wrapper for tesseract)
- OpenCV
